Changes to the original version of Neal 2012:
- rearrangement of some code
- free memory that's not needed anymore
- change the programs in a way that they don't input and output files
  but work on buffers.
- replace make_method enums by ints
- strip away all the code that doesn't have to do with matrix
  representation, matrix creation, encoding, decoding and helper files
- adapt the make file for compilation to webassembly and asm.js
- removed abandon_number and abandon_when from LU decomposition
- added include guards

TODO:
- embed random numbers
- replace aborts with exits
- reduce buffer size used by emcc Module
