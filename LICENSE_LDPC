Changes to the original version of Neal 2012:
- rearrangement of some code
- Free memory that's not needed anymore. Note that freeing the memory is
  important even if the execution terminates as the instance is kept alive
  (emcc option NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1). In case of error however, still memory
  can leak as in this case the method only frees it's own memory, arguments
  and globals but not the memory of parent methods.
- change the programs in a way that they don't input and output files
  but work on buffers.
- replace make_method enums by ints
- replace channel enum by ints
- strip away all the code that doesn't have to do with matrix
  representation, matrix creation, encoding, decoding and helper files
- adapt the make file for compilation to webassembly and asm.js
- removed abandon_number and abandon_when from LU decomposition
- added include guards
- remove support for dense and mixed matrix representation
- remove support for decoding by enumerating all possible codewords
- remove support for printing decode steps to the console
- remove support for encoding / decoding multiple blocks at once.
- remove global variables in dec.h
- replace the random generator by xorshift64*
- removed support for irregular column weight distribution
- add a RELEASE flag to print less debug info in release mode

TODO:
- reduce buffer size used by emcc Module and autogrow
- cache H and G
- maybe use RA LDPC matrices or use almost linear encoding
